That\'s fine, but you should be aware that the content in this game will probably be too easy for you. \n\nThis mod was balanced for characters with a karma of around 85. You can get that by choosing to create a new character in this game, or by creating a new character in Antumbra or Antumbra 2: Eclipse and then importing that."
