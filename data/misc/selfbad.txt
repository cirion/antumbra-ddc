The Sixth World has grown rather jaded after decades of wars, social upheaval, and magical awakenings. And yet, the entire globe seems to pause in surprise at the news trickling out of CalFree. Tir Tairngire, the great elven nation, undefeated in battle, was abruptly stopped in its imminent conquest of its southern neighbor by the sudden appearance of the great dragon Hestaby.

The copper dragon was unlike any the world had seen before. She appeared uninterested in the games of power and wealth played by other dragons, and instead focused her considerable talents on propagating peace, reversing ecological harm, and protecting metahumans from prejudice. While some would argue that she merely pursued a more subtle plan for domination, the people of the Pacific Coast increasingly viewed her as a benevolent godmother.

Witnesses to the shocking events at the Battle of Shasta Dam knew that Hestaby did not act alone: she received crucial and timely assistance from a former shadowrunner who led Redding’s militia in a desperate battle against Tir’s forces. After the crisis passed, the independent-minded folks attracted by the runner drifted on to their next jobs, and eventually the runner drifted on as well. They were gone, but not forgotten: Redding remembered their savior, even if the rest of the world only recalled the dragon.

Of course, the world continued on as it ever did. Greedy corporations continued to plunder the land and its people. The vast majority of dragons continued to accumulate obscene amounts of wealth. Metatypes squared off against humans, or against one another. In such a swirling sea of violence and subterfuge, people will always need a runner. With the legacy of Shasta Dam behind them, this particular runner became known as someone who could get anything, ANYTHING, done. And besides, how many other runners carry a favor from a dragon in their back pocket?
