The Sixth World has grown rather jaded after decades of wars, social upheaval, and magical awakenings. And yet, the entire globe seems to pause in surprise at the news trickling out of CalFree. Tir Tairngire, the great elven nation, undefeated in battle, was abruptly stopped in its imminent conquest of its southern neighbor by the sudden appearance of the great dragon Hestaby.

The copper dragon was unlike any the world had seen before. She appeared uninterested in the games of power and wealth played by other dragons, and instead focused her considerable talents on propagating peace, reversing ecological harm, and protecting metahumans from prejudice. While some would argue that she merely pursued a more subtle plan for domination, the people of the Pacific Coast increasingly viewed her as a benevolent godmother.

Witnesses to the shocking events at the Battle of Shasta Dam knew that Hestaby did not act alone: she received crucial and timely assistance from a former shadowrunner who led Redding’s militia in a desperate battle against Tir’s forces. The rich and powerful Japanese megacorps in San Francisco recognized the extraordinary talents of the runner, whose actions had saved their CalFree headquarters from likely annihilation. Mitsuhama’s paramilitary contracting arm absorbed the surviving members of the militia, and offered the runner a cushy, lucrative desk job at their arcology in San Francisco.

In the years to come, a new equilibrium settled over the region. The megacorps continued to expand, keeping a wary eye on the dragon and taking advantage of their sudden salvation from the threat posed by Tir. Eventually, the runner's name was lost to time… but few people from the shadows ever did so much to bend the course of history.
