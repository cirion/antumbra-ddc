The Sixth World has grown rather jaded after decades of wars, social upheaval, and magical awakenings. And yet, the entire globe seems to pause in surprise at the news trickling out of CalFree. Tir Tairngire, the great elven nation, undefeated in battle, was abruptly stopped in its imminent conquest of its southern neighbor by the sudden appearance of the great dragon Hestaby.

The copper dragon was unlike any the world had seen before. She appeared uninterested in the games of power and wealth played by other dragons, and instead focused her considerable talents on propagating peace, reversing ecological harm, and protecting metahumans from prejudice. While some would argue that she merely pursued a more subtle plan for domination, the people of the Pacific Coast increasingly viewed her as a benevolent godmother.

Witnesses to the shocking events at the Battle of Shasta Dam knew that Hestaby did not act alone: she received crucial and timely assistance from a former shadowrunner who led Redding’s militia in a desperate battle against Tir’s forces. The habitually ineffective and corrupt government in Sacramento was embarrassed by their failure to defend the state, and sought to save face by thanking the runner as a savior of CalFree. Over time the capital became more active in the region, transferring the headquarters of the California Rangers to Redding and offering the runner a position in the state’s bureaucracy.

As the 2050s approached their turbulent end, CalFree was increasingly wracked by internal strife and division. The totalitarian Colonel Saito would soon recognize his chance and march forth from San Francisco, laying claim to an even larger swath of territory. In the times to come, CalFree would be pleased to have at their disposal someone with a history of effectively sparring with the Colonel. Those who run in the shadows will always be needed by desperate people facing long odds, and this runner had proven their worth.
